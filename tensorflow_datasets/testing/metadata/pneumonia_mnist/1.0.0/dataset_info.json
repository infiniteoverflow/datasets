  "description": "# MedMNIST Pneumonia Dataset\n\nThe PneumoniaMNIST is based on a prior dataset of 5,856 pediatric chest X-Ray\nimages. The task is binary-class classification of pneumonia against normal. The\nsource training set is split with a ratio of 9:1 into training and validation\nset, and use its source validation set as the test set. The source images are\ngray-scale, and their sizes are (384\u20132,916) \u00d7 (127\u20132,713). The images are\ncenter-cropped with a window size of length of the short edge and resized into 1\n\u00d7 28 \u00d7 28.",
